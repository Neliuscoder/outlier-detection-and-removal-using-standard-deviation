# outlier-detection-and-removal-using-standard-deviation
In this repository, I explore how to detect and remove outliers in data using a standard deviation-based approach. The code demonstrates how to identify and handle outliers in Python using the standard deviation, which is based on the number of standard deviations from the mean.
